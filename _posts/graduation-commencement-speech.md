# Graduation Commencement Speech

Graduation is more than a ceremony—it's a celebration of growth, resilience, and the communities that shape us. On this page, I’m sharing my full commencement speech, a video of the moment, and a link to the official article from the University of Houston. Whether you’re a fellow graduate, a friend, or just curious, I hope these words and memories inspire you as much as this journey has inspired me.

## 📝 Speech Transcript

> Good evening, faculty, families, friends, and most importantly, fellow graduates.
> 
> When they asked me to speak today, I thought about what wisdom I could possibly offer. The truth is, when I began my college journey, I never expected to be standing here at the University of Houston getting my degree in Computer Science. This wasn't part of my plan. But life rarely follows the routes we map out for ourselves.
> 
> I remember arriving on campus during orientation, feeling a bit lost and without a community. Having undergone brain surgery just a week earlier, I carried not only physical scars but also a profound sense of isolation. I felt like I was standing at the edge of a dense forest with no clear path forward. And that day, something changed when I went to eat lunch at Moody. With the two friends I had just met during orientation, I found myself in a space that felt surprisingly normal, despite everything being new. Something about their company made me feel at ease enough to remove the hat that had been concealing my freshly shaven head and the visible scars from surgery. It wasn't that I was tired of hiding, but rather that for the first time since my operation, I felt like I was in a regular environment where I could just be myself, surgery or not. In that moment of authenticity, these two people—who didn't even share my major or college—became the beginning of the community that would carry me through my years at UH. Removing my hat and revealing my true self that day at Moody, I took those first steps. They were small but transformative, and that began my journey toward finding my place here.
> 
> Some of those next steps were uncertain. Some led to dead ends. But each one taught me something new about myself and the journey I was on.
> 
> We often fixate on destinations—the perfect job, the right relationship, the ideal life. We think success means following a predetermined route. But what I've learned here at UH is that the journey isn't about the route you take but the vehicle you're in and the community you bring with you along the way.
> 
> The vehicle is you—your resilience, your passion, and your willingness to adapt. How you drive determines whether you'll make it through the storms, the traffic jams, and the unexpected detours that life inevitably throws at you. It's not about having the fastest car or the most direct path. It's about how you handle the wheel when the road gets rough.
> 
> And the community? They're your fellow travelers—the professors who challenged you, the friends who supported you, the family who believed in you even when you didn't believe in yourself. They're the ones who helped change your flat tires, who navigated when you were too tired to read the map, who celebrated with you when you discovered beautiful views along the way.
> 
> I found my community here at UH. People from different backgrounds, with different dreams, all traveling their own journeys but willing to share the road for a while. They showed me that while our paths may diverge, we can still move forward together.
> 
> This university has taught me gratitude for the journey itself, not just the destination. Gratitude for the vehicle that I've become and the passengers who've shared the ride.
> 
> As we graduate today, none of us know exactly where we'll end up. The road ahead will twist and turn in ways we can't predict. But we know how to take that next step. We know how to drive our own vehicles. And we carry with us the community that helped us reach this milestone.
> 
> So fellow graduates, as you leave here today, remember: You may not always know your final destination, but you are in charge of your journey. Drive with purpose. Embrace the detours. And be grateful for the ride, even when it's messy or imperfect.
> 
> Because sometimes the most beautiful destinations are the ones we never planned to visit.
> 
> Congratulations, Class of 2025. The journey continues.

Hello!! For those that may not have known me, I was a Contractor SWE Intern at NASA for 3 semesters (Spring 2024, Fall 2024, and Spring 2025). People have always asked me about my time and process from how I reached out, how my interview went, what my work was like, etc etc; so, I decided to make a blog about it to answer these questions all in one go.

## My Outreach & Career Fair Process

So, it all started my freshman year when I found out about this opportunity about LZTechnology (a contractor company) from my fellow CS majors. I missed talking to them at career fair, but sent a cold email the month before summer started. Got a response, but they told me for the moment that they were filled. After summer ended, I find myself at the Fall 2023 CS Career Fair at UH. I found the LZ table and immediately made my way to it. Just as I got there one of the recruiters also just made it in, so I happened to be the first to talk to her. I just remember how much of a passion dump I was giving talking about all the friends that I've heard about this opportunity from and why I'm so interested, and just being as genuine and authentic with my words as I could be and finally handing in my resume and talking about the very little experience I had as a sophomore just starting to take Data Structures. Fast forward to the next week and I receive a random call, and this call just happened to be that recruiter I spoke with. She said she remembered me very distinctly from our interaction and that she really wanted to pass me to the next stage and reassured my candidacy remaining being considered. Another week or two pass by and I finally get an email for an interview invite with the contractor company.

TLDR: Persistence paid off - I missed the opportunity initially but followed up with a cold email. When I finally met the recruiter at the next career fair, genuine enthusiasm and authenticity made me memorable enough to get a callback, even with limited sophomore-year experience.

## My Interview Process

I start doing some basic behavioral interview prep over the days in between my invite and the interview itself. Finally, the day arrives and I was definitely a little nervous, but the moment the call started my nerves started fading away. My interviewer was very sweet, and pronounced my name right on the first go which was something I had never really experienced before, so it felt like it was off to a great start already. I was asked questions about why I chose my major and details concering my work and project experiences. The call felt like it was going on forever with how connected we got and how authentic I was giving my story once again. Finally the interview came to a close and she also reassured me and said that once a team at NASA has intern space opening up, the team will reach out to me and the next steps will commence.

That gap was definitely a hard one to feel patient in since it took about a month to two months to hear back, but eventually, I do. It was a team called CRONUS, and for context this team was the one working in mission control as a flight controlling team behind ISS focusing on the computers onboard and the data retrieval whether it be audio, video, photo, or just general data forms. I, once again did a little behavioral prep, and ran headfirst into the interview. It was with who would be my manager and mentor involved in the software engineering side. The manager asked me questions about my work experiences, and their favorite was definitely the one about my experience as a TA for the Python course as they centered a lot of work around Python during that time, questioned about why I wanted NASA and what I really cared to get out of it and how the internship would help me get there. Next, the interview pivoted over to the mentor interviewer and he started giving me brief explanations of four projects that they have on their roadmap and started asking me which one I would like and if I already have experience doing any similar things. The interview came to a close, and at the moment I felt nervous because the faces seemed so serious that I thought I was being shamed for a bad performance. I followed up about an hour later expressing my gratitude for the experience, and within a couple minutes, the manager emails me saying that they really enjoyed the interview and that they were actually signing papers to get me in but were waiting till they were done to confirm it with me.

TLDR: The biggest part of it all felt like it was about being honest and genuine with every word I was saying and the tone behind how much I cared about my experiences and story and how interested I was in growing myself and learning more. Technical skills matter, but NASA seemed equally interested in finding someone with passion, adaptability, and a genuine desire to learn and contribute to their mission.

During my time at NASA, I worked across two different teams on a variety of projects that helped me grow both technically and professionally.

### CRONUS:

* **Machine Learning Signal Predictor**
   * Used Python, Pandas, NumPy, Lxml, and PyTorch to build a prediction model
   * Created comprehensive documentation for future engineers
   * Implemented a neural network from scratch to predict acquisition of signal (AOS) metrics
   * Optimized the model's performance speed by 12%
   * Analyzed parameters like TDRS events and Sun alpha, beta, and gamma (ABG) angles
   * Processed S-band azimuth and elevation angles from previous events stored in XML files

* **General Technical Skills Gained:**
   * Linux environment, gvim text editor, and GitLab version control
   * NASA-specific tools and protocols

* **Gateway Loads Model Database**
   * Developed a database system to catalog the Powered Equipment List (PEL) for NASA's Gateway spacecraft
   * Initially worked with SQLite DBMS and Python before pivoting to MS Access conversion from Excel
   * Created an organized system that improved data accessibility and reduced search time

* **Keyboard Camera Controller**
   * Developed a tool allowing mission control flight controllers to manipulate cameras using keyboard shortcuts
   * Learned Perl and pyQT while tackling various bug fixes
   * Improved controller response time and usability for flight controllers

* **Rudimentary Telemetry Processor**
   * Utilized Mission Control Center API to receive and process realtime data
   * Built a system to interpret telemetry for console operations

* **Non-technical Experience:**
   * Shadowed both realtime and simulated mission control environments in front room and backroom operations
   * Actively participated in mission simulations
   * Toured JSC facilities including the International Space Station mockup

### Challenges & Growth:
The biggest challenge was working in areas where even my team had limited expertise. During my AI/ML project, I found myself largely self-teaching since my team wasn't primarily focused on software engineering and had limited AI/ML experience. This pushed me to develop independent research skills and resourcefulness.

### Skills Developed:
* NASA acronyms and terminology (there are A LOT!)
* Technical skills: PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, Lxml, PERL, SQLite, MS Access, Linux, gvim, and GitLab
* Documentation writing and reading
* Effective communication in technical meetings
* Work organization and responsibility management
* Maintaining an open mind and continuous learning attitude

### ESCO Work:
* **Account Management Tool**
   * Automated deployment of accounts and hosts
   * Developed with C++, working with Linux and Virtual Machines
   * Created detailed documentation for each implementation step
   * Improved efficiency of account provisioning system

### Challenges & Growth at ESCO:
The biggest challenge during my time with ESCO was navigating NASA's governmental Return to Office (RTO) mandate. The commute between work and home became physically draining, and the structured office schedule created new time management challenges. There were also administrative waiting periods between project phases that tested my  adaptability.

### Skills Developed at ESCO:
* Advanced Linux system administration
* Security protocols including Yubikey implementation
* Lower-level programming concepts beyond what I'd learned in coursework
* Computational networking fundamentals

## My Teams

### CRONUS: Communications RF Onboard Networks Utilization Specialist
This team was responsible for managing command and data handling, communications, and tracking systems, including onboard computers, video cameras, and the Caution and Warning system. Their work directly supported astronauts aboard the ISS by ensuring reliable data and communication channels.

### ESCO: Exploration Software for Crew Operations
ESCO managed the tablets onboard the station, handling apps and account deployment. This team ensured astronauts had functioning and secure software tools for their daily operations.

### Team Structures:
* **CRONUS** was primarily console-focused for Mission Control, with fewer people dedicated to software production and more focused on realtime operations
* **ESCO** had a larger software development contingent working across different projects, plus an information security team

### My Role:
I served as a Software Engineer Intern on both teams, contributing to specific projects while learning about the broader mission context.

### Mentorship:
* At CRONUS, I had two intern mentors who taught me about realtime console operations and provided valuable mission context
* Each team assigned me a project mentor - both were experienced engineers with extensive knowledge of lower-level programming and Linux systems
* These mentors guided my project work, helped me set goals, and planned my next steps, providing invaluable career advice along the way

## The Culture at NASA

![image](https://www.houstonmod.org/wp-content/uploads/HM_S66-42379_NASA_Aerial.jpg)

The JSC campus itself is really nice and beautiful - very green with wildlife freely roaming around. Many buildings almost like museums, with really cool space artifacts and technology (Buildings 9, 5, 7, 30, 1, 4S and 4N were particularly impressive).

There's a sense of purpose that brings everyone working there together. Despite being a contractor, I felt connected to NASA's mission and the importance of space exploration. The culture balances serious, mission-critical work with genuine excitement about space and discovery.

Every employee, regardless of position, understands how their work contributes to the bigger picture. This creates an environment where asking questions is encouraged and learning is constant. My mentors were always willing to explain concepts, regardless of how basic, and there was never a sense that any question was too simple.

## Conclusion

My time at NASA was genuinely transformative. Working across three semesters with different teams allowed me to see various aspects of space operations and develop a diverse skill set. The experience went far beyond technical learning - it showed me what it means to be part of something larger than yourself, working alongside dedicated professionals united by a common mission.

For anyone interested in similar opportunities, my advice is simple: be persistent, authentic, and passionate. NASA values these qualities as much as technical skills. Even if you think you don't have enough experience, apply anyway - your enthusiasm and willingness to learn might be exactly what they're looking for.

The path to NASA isn't always straightforward, but the journey is worth it. Whether you're reaching out through career fairs, sending cold emails, or networking with alumni, keep pushing forward. Space exploration needs diverse perspectives and fresh ideas, and your unique contribution might be exactly what's needed to solve the next big challenge in human spaceflight.
